If you have an idea, just add it to this list:
User-Defined Exceptions
toastr support
add icons for details, edit, delete, review on the homepage
change the previous and next buttons to change pages to numbers instead for what page youre on
make book reviews tables look nicer
optional: use javscript to adjust the sort functions so that the page doesnt reloads everytime
optional: add links dynamically to each book entry that takes you to a page like amazon
